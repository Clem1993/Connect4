# Connect4 Use mode
We will describe bellow how to make this code works,then we will make some part of the improvement related to this project. I have spent arround 6 hours to create this project. 

## How to activate the connect 4

To make this code works you can use the virtual environment for that you can use the `recquirements.txt` into this project. You can create a virttual environment with `conda`. 

```bash 
conda create --name your_env --file recquirements.txt
```

Then you can do this command to be on this virtual environment 

```bash 
conda activate your_env
```
To activate this project you should use this command 
```bash 
python main.py
```

Into the directory `test` you can do some test with the commande bellow 
```bash 
pytest
```


Then You will just have to follow the instructions displayed on the screen and enjoy the game. 

## Improvement 

- Quality code  : I think that i can make this code more compact to improve the quality code 
- Add some GUI, I did not have the time to produce 
- I was not able to find a simple way to execute `pytest` outside the `test` directory
